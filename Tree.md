# RGB Christmas Tree

The [RGB Christmas Tree](https://thepihut.com/products/rainbow-led-christmas-tree-for-micro-bit) contains six LEDs which can change colour - these are something called "neopixels" it would seem. The six lights are connected through one GPIO connector and are called "individually addressable" - so you can control them individually, and set each of them to be a different colour or brightness.

## Basic Connections

Unlike an LED this needs _tree_ wires connecting up - one to control the power, one for controlling it and one to complete the circuit. Connect GND on micro:bit to (G) on the tree, 3V to (V) and 0 to (S) - traditionally you use red for 3V, black for GND and yellow for the signal control like:

In this one they have connected pin 1 not zero, but the idea is the same.

## Controlling

The LEDs are numbered 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 as there are six LEDs and computer people count from zero. As there are six we need to make a neopixel array with six spaces with:

```python
import neopixel
import microbit

np = neopixel.NeoPixel(microbit.pin0, 6)
```

This says that you have six LEDs connected to 0. You can control the brightness and colour by setting how bright the red, green and blue channels are - white light would be made up of them being the same. The brightness is in a range from 0 (off) to 255 (maximum brightness) so if you do:

```python
import neopixel
import microbit
import time

np = neopixel.NeoPixel(microbit.pin0, 6)
for j in range(10):
    for b in range(255):
        np[0] = (b, b, b)
    np.show()
    time.sleep(0.01)
```

should make the bottom LED pulse from dim to bright white 10 times. If
you want to make another LED light up, change `[0]` to `[1]` to
`[5]`. 

## Blinking

If you want to change the colour of the LED from white, make the three
numbers _different_ e.g. if you set just the first number to `b` above
then the others to zero like:

```Python
np[0] = (b, 0, 0)
```

then the light will stay red, and become brighter and dimmer. Let's
make _all_ the lights twinkle different colours...

```python
import neopixel
import microbit
import random
import time

black = (0, 0, 0)
red = (255, 0, 0)
green = (0, 255, 0)
blue = (0, 0, 255)
yellow = (255, 255, 0)
cyan = (0, 255, 255)
magenta = (255, 0, 255)
white = (255, 255, 255)

colours = (black, red, green, blue, yellow, cyan, magenta, white)

np = neopixel.NeoPixel(machine.pin0, 6)

for j in range(1000):
    for l in range(6):
        np[l] = random.choice(colours)
    np.show()
    time.sleep(0.1)
```

This should twinkle for a couple of minutes... you may want to set the colours by hand to see that I have the codes right too!
